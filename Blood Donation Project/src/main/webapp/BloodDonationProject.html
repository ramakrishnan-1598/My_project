		<h3>RECIPEINT SAFETY :</h3>
		<p>Donors are screened for health risks that could make the
			donation unsafe for the recipient. Some of these restrictions are
			controversial, such as restricting donations from men who have sex
			with men (MSM) because of the risk of transmitting HIV.[21] In 2011,
			the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) reduced its blanket ban on MSM
			donors to a narrower restriction which only prevents MSM from
			donating blood if they have had sex with other men within the past
			year.[22] A similar change was made in the US in late 2015 by the
			Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[23] In 2017, the UK and US
			further reduced their restrictions to three months.[24] In 2023, the
			FDA announced new policies easing restrictions on gay and bisexual
			men donating blood.[25] These updated guidelines stipulate that men
			in monogamous relationships with other men, or who have not recently
			had sex, can donate.[25] Individuals who report having sex with
			people who are HIV positive or have had sex with a new partner who
			has engaged in anal sex are still barred from blood donation.[25]
			Autologous donors are not always screened for recipient safety
			problems since the donor is the only person who will receive the
			blood.[26] Since the donated blood may be given to pregnant women or
			women of child-bearing age, donors taking teratogenic (birth
			defect-causing) medications are deferred. These medications include
			acitretin, etretinate, isotretinoin, finasteride.</p>
